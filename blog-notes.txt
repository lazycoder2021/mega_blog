MEGA ensures that the only people who can access your data are the people you choose. MEGA provides user-controlled end-to-end encryption for your data, chat and calls without sacrificing the flexibility you need to get the job done.

Manage your growing team with MEGA
MEGA allows you to easily add new members to your growing team. They will automatically become contacts with all other members of the business, allowing you to easily share files, chat or call them.

Quick and easy sharing means you can just get on with work
Easily create file or folder links that can be shared with your team members or sent to your customers. You can delete the links and thus remove access to the files or folders at any time. You can also set an expiry date or add password protection to any link.

Securely share your files
With MEGAâ€™s unlimited file size, no file is ever too big. Sharing a large file securely has never been easier. Simply set up a link from your computer or mobile device. You can also protect it with a password or make it available only for a limited time.

Make secure calls or chat with your team, suppliers and customers
You can contact your team securely using our user-controlled end-to-end encrypted chat, audio and video call capability. With MEGA you stay secure while working together at any time from any device using a browser or our MEGA Mobile Apps.
