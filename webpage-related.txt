1. always write for ideal customer 

2. use simple, conversational english, avoid jargons

3. connect with your customers (use emotions, be human) 

	- example: even a 70 year old grandpa can use mega to connect with his grandson living across the world, it's that simple to use
        - IS BETTER THAN example: mega offers high quality video calls and screen sharing features 

4. make your web page scannable 
	- headers and sub-headers
	- bullet points
	- short 3-4 line paras, one idea per para
	- use images/keywords (within the first 100 words) 

5. format (design) your web page well  - font-size, white spage, line-height -- all this matters 

6. be humble and credible -- the world's best video calling software does not cut it anymore 
			  -- instead use terms like: video calling software for all your needs, , makes online 			     meetings easier, even 70 year old grandpa's can use etc, address customer pain point

7. present the important first -- or always write with the end in mind
